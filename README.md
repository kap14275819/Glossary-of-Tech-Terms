## Definition of an algorithm:
#### An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks. An algorithm is an effective method that can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. A simpler way of is that it is a set of rules or instructions that are followed in order to complete a task or to solve a problem.

## Process in building and application:
### Step 1. Meeting With The Client
#### Firstly there will be a meeting with the client which you will discuss with them about their design and what they want from their application. Other things such as discussing deadlines so you can know how long you have to complete it and then also any negotiable payment for the work. Contracts are common to be signed or agreed on at this time and stage of the project if money is involved. 

### Step 2. Decide on working in a team or decide to work alone
#### This is the time on whether you want to work in a team and decide who will be working with you on this project, contact or arrange meetings with a designer or a developer and then persuade them to get on board with the project. This can be decided whether you want to undertake the project alone, but this would take more time than with a team.

### Step 3. Design
#### The first step you take in the project is to have a planned out idea and then create a design documentation and a concept art that will explain all the features that the app will have. Concept images will be also in this but they will have to be as close to how the design of the app will look like in the end. In this documentation it should also consist of different colours, features, fonts ect.

### Step 4. Development
#### In the development stage you will have to start coding the app and all the mechanics that it will have. In this stage if any problems or mistakes that will occur during this process can be very costly, both in time and money. So making sure that you follow your clear plan and design before hand is critically important.

### Step 5. Testing
#### This stage is one of the most important parts of the porject as you have to make sure that you have not got any bugs or errors within the application so that it works perfectly. This can be done along side the development so that you can correct the errors whilst writing the code. But in the end there should be a final "Beta test" before release to make sure that the whole application is in full working condition.

### Step 6. Presenting final design to the Client
#### Once you have done all the designs and coding and the application is finished then you can create a small presentation to show the final product to the client so that they can be shown on the app and on a PowerPoint presentation to know what you have done and any changes made.

## Explanation of the three Paradigms:
#### There are many different types of programming that have been developed over the years. Each programming language falls into one of three programming paradigms: event-driven, procedural, or object-orientated. These three categories help the development of new, efficient and error-free programming languages.

### Procedural:
#### Procedural paradigms is where programs are broken down into procedures or functions. Procedural programming uses multiple procedures that are linked to the main program. Each procedure has a specific purpose and is called by the main program when a user enters the command to do so or a specific critera is met. This usually directly instructs a computer to complete a specific task that you want it to do in logical steps.
### Characteristics:
#### 1. Puts much importance on Things to be Done.
#### 2. Large problems are divided into smaller programs known as functions.
#### 3. Most of the functions share global data.
#### 4. Data move openly around the system from function to function.
#### 5. Functions transfer data from one form to another.
#### 6. Employs top-down approach in program designing.
#### 7. In the cases of large program, bringing change is difficult and time consuming.
#### 8. Appropriate and effective techniques are unavailable to secure data of a function from others.

### Object-Orientated:
#### Object-oriented paradigms breaks down a program into objects. This is different to procedural programming as it uses a different structural format to procedural. Object-oriented programming was developed to deal with the complexities of more advanced systems when procedural programming couldn't address the difficulties the system faced. These paradigms link data and functions together in the building blocks of objects. The objects in this form of programming are based on real world objects which are relevant to the system being developed. This programming paradigm allow the used to change the functions of the program easily as the code is typically stored in classes. Java and C++ are examples of object-orientated programming.
### Characteristics:
#### 1. Emphasis on data rather than procedure
#### 2. Programs are divided into entities known as objects
#### 3. Data Structures are designed such that they characterize objects
#### 4. Functions that operate on data of an object are tied together in data structures
#### 5. Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external functions
#### 6. Objects communicate with each other through functions
#### 7. New data and functions can be easily added whenever necessary
#### 8. Follows bottom up design in program design

### Event-Driven:
#### Event-driven programming is a computer programming paradigm where a program responds to an event that has happpened die to the user input. This type of programming is different to the other programming paradigms as the system does not respond to the structure of the program; although the program structure can follow a similar technique to object-orientated programming. Event-driven programming follows the movements of the user to determine the flow of the program; and requires the programmer to write event procedures to respond to the user’s inputs. 
### Characteristics:
#### 1. Provides services that are available on a network, so the code doesn’t have to be rewritten every time it is needed. (Service Oriented)
#### 2. Relies on time for it to work, can be based off of a timer in which it lasts until the timer ends. (Time Driven)
#### 3. Event handlers relate to a certain even such as clicking on a button.
#### 4. Trigger functions decide what causes the event to take place. Every object has a range of trigger functions that can be used to run the event.
#### 5. Event loops look for any events to occur and are there to detect any changes that may have occured.

### The Relationship Between then:
#### The relationship between the three paradigms is that each of them are based around functions and they all implement them in different ways. As an example, Event-Driven links the function to a user event, Procedural calls the functions when asked and Object-Orientated is able to link a function to an object through a class and other methods. The three paradigms almost evolve of that one that came before it as each of them expand on the idea of implementing functions.
#### Each of the paradigms deal with the following which is Input/Output, Variables, Repetition, Decisions and Data Structures.

## Debugging process:
#### The debugging process is very helpful and useful for every coder as it allows you to look over the your working code in the console and check whether any errors have occured in the process. This is usually in some certain IDE's where they have both an text editor and a console next to it which you can use to run the code. If they have a type of debugging process, then you are able to read and check through what line in the code has affected the program. This then makes sure the program is in working order and to make it more robust. Without this, the code affect might not be shown and so you will not be able to know what is the problem with the code. Which may then cause problems in the future. Some IDE's also have a debugger already integrated which is also known as a debugging tool which is a software program to test and find bugs within your programs.

#### The debugging process is very useful as it can be used to develop more secure and robust applications. Using this allows you to check through your programme that you have created to make sure that there are no errors that oocur whilst it is running. In the application it might look perfectly fine but the debugger might say that there is a problem but you cannot notice it. The debugger will able to spot these things so that you can make sure that the security of your application is held together and to make sure that it is robust when using the application.

## The Importance of Team Dynamics
#### Team Dynamics referes to anything to do with the relationship between the members of a team and how it impacts the perfomace of the team. Dynamics can be affected by certain variables such as roles and responsabilities and all have an affect on productivity. For example, if a group of 4 friends were working together on a project, this past relationship could have a positive or a negative impact on how well the team works together. The friends past relationship could allow them to get to work more quickly, and understand each others strengths and weaknesses straight away, allowing each member to work to their strengths and support each other easily. On the other hand, the group could easily begin to argue, as they would likley spend their time outside of the work enviroment together too and personal arguments could then affect the performance of memebers. 

## Coding standard Evaluation:
#### The coding standard is neccessary for both the team and the individual, because both individual and team will understand simple standards that will help them in the process when coding their programs in the future. It will also help them in the speed of coding such as the indenting instead of pressing the space button. But also the commenting which allows anyone reading through the code including the creator of the code to understand what that part of code does exactly.
