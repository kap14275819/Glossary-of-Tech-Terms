## Definition of an algorithm:
#### A set of mathematical instructions or rules that, especially if given to a computer, will help to calculate an answer to a problem 


## Explanation of the three Paradigms:
### Procedural:
#### Procedural paradigms is where programs are broken down into procedures or functions. Procedural programming uses multiple procedures that are linked to the main program. Each procedure has a specific purpose and is called by the main program when a user enters the command to do so or a specific critera is met. This usually directly instructs a computer to complete a specific task that you want it to do in logical steps.

### Object-Orientated:
#### Object-oriented paradigms breaks down a program into objects. This is different to procedural programming as it uses a different structural format to procedural. Object-oriented programming was developed to deal with the complexities of more advanced systems when procedural programming couldn't address the difficulties the system faced. 

### Event-Driven:
####
