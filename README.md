## Definition of an algorithm:
#### A set of mathematical instructions or rules that, especially if given to a computer, will help to calculate an answer to a problem 


## Explanation of the three Paradigms:
### Procedural:
#### Procedural paradigms is where programs are broken down into procedures or functions. Procedural programming uses multiple procedures that are linked to the main program. Each procedure has a specific purpose and is called by the main program when a user enters the command to do so or a specific critera is met. This usually directly instructs a computer to complete a specific task that you want it to do in logical steps.

### Object-Orientated:
#### Object-oriented paradigms breaks down a program into objects. This is different to procedural programming as it uses a different structural format to procedural. Object-oriented programming was developed to deal with the complexities of more advanced systems when procedural programming couldn't address the difficulties the system faced. These paradigms link data and functions together in the building blocks of objects. The objects in this form of programming are based on real world objects which are relevant to the system being developed. This programming paradigm allow the used to change the functions of the program easily as the code is typically stored in classes. Java and C++ are examples of object-orientated programming.

### Event-Driven:
