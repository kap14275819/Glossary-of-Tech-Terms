# Glossary-of-Tech-Terms

## Definition of an algorithm:
#### A set of mathematical instructions or rules that, especially if given to a computer, will help to calculate an answer to a problem 


## Explanation of the three Paradigms:
#### There are many different types of programming that have been developed over the years. Each programming language falls into one of three programming paradigms: event-driven, procedural, or object-orientated. These three categories help the development of new, efficient and error-free programming languages.
### Procedural:
#### Procedural paradigms is where programs are broken down into procedures or functions. Procedural programming uses multiple procedures that are linked to the main program. Each procedure has a specific purpose and is called by the main program when a user enters the command to do so or a specific critera is met. This usually directly instructs a computer to complete a specific task that you want it to do in logical steps.

### Object-Orientated:
#### Object-oriented paradigms breaks down a program into objects. This is different to procedural programming as it uses a different structural format to procedural. Object-oriented programming was developed to deal with the complexities of more advanced systems when procedural programming couldn't address the difficulties the system faced. These paradigms link data and functions together in the building blocks of objects. The objects in this form of programming are based on real world objects which are relevant to the system being developed. This programming paradigm allow the used to change the functions of the program easily as the code is typically stored in classes. Java and C++ are examples of object-orientated programming.

### Event-Driven:
#### Event-driven programming is a computer programming paradigm where a program responds to an event that has happpened die to the user input. This type of programming is different to the other programming paradigms as the system does not respond to the structure of the program; although the program structure can follow a similar technique to object-orientated programming. Event-driven programming follows the movements of the user to determine the flow of the program; and requires the programmer to write event procedures to respond to the userâ€™s inputs.

## Debugging process:
#### The debugging process is very helpful and useful for every coder as it allows you to look over the your working code in the console and check whether any errors have occured in the process. If they have then you are able to read and check through what line in the code has affected the program. This then makes sure the program is in working order and to make it more robust. Without this, the code affect might not be shown and so you will not be able to know what is the problem with the code. Which may then cause problems in the future.

## Coding standard Evaluation:
#### The coding standard is neccessary for both the team and the individual, because both individual and team will understand simple standards that will help them in the process when coding their programs in the future. It will also help them in the speed of coding such as the indenting instead of pressing the space button. But also the commenting which allows anyone reading through the code including the creator of the code to understand what that part of code does exactly.
